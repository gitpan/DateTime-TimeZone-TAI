TODO for DateTime::TimeZone::TAI
================================

 - On a leap second, the output of the module is one second off. This
   is because of a bug in DateTime.pm; it is at this moment (DateTime
   version 0.24) not possible to work around this bug. As soon as
   DateTime is fixed, this module will be fixed as well.

 - In DateTime::new(), the TAI "timezone" cannot be mentioned by name;
   it has to be created first with DT::TZ::TAI::new(). This is because
   it has a one part name ("TAI"), which is not accepted by
   DT::TZ::new(). Either DT::TZ::new or the name of this module has to
   be changed.
